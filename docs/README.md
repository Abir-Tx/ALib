# ALib
Modern cross platform C++ header only library which features many useful utility functions which can be used in your personal project.
ALib provides many usefull functions which are not available in the **built in** or **standard** C++ library like decorating a text.

The motivation of this project is to get rid of writing most/frequently needed functions/codes again & again for different project. Which is tedious & not the prommatic way of doing things. Also this library packs some decorating functions.

# Features

- Cross Platform - The same function works on Windows, Linux and Mac OS
- Extremely extensible - The **ALib** is very modular as it is function based. So you can easily change or add features to a function as you need by modifying the source code.
- Supports colored decorations - ALib uses a 3rd Party library called **rang** to produce colored text output.
